- Sharon: Spent a long time trying to understand SDL but couldn't really understand all of it. Also had issues with fully downloading the library. Finally worked on just printing out the welcome screen and board.
- William: Created basic files necessary for code

<b> January 8 2019 </b>
- Sharon: Finally think I figured out SDL. Uploaded necessary folders that include the headers. Tested some code to create a window but am still unclear about some things.

- Sharon: I did not end up figuring out SDL. For one part, the code seemed to compile but no screen showed up even though the program was running. It was a really hard process to look through online tutorials because a lot of the codes were for C++ and I ended up just getting really confused on what I should be using.
